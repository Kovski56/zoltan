# Zoltan

Zoltan is a polyphonic browser-based synthesizer written in Javascript using the [reactronica](https://github.com/unkleho/reactronica) library. The project is currently in the early alpha stages, so expect breaking changes to be frequent. Note: currently doesn't work on iOS due to [a bug](https://github.com/markjamesm/zoltan/issues/3).

## Live Demo
